# ChessView
Based upon overhead visual of chess board, the program provides the exact board position of each piece.
-The goal of this project was to be able to develop an effective method of being able to scan each and every piece on the board
 and return its position on the board, based on the provided image.

**Instructions On How to Use:**
-To use the program, first setup your chessboard, with all the pieces in their initial positions. This is the initialization step
-Then take an overhead photo of this chessboard setup, with preferrably overhead lighting, so as to reduce and shadows.
-Then crop the corners of the image so the only things visible are the squares. (a sample image of what it should look is provided

_Needed Dependencies_
-OpenCV
-Numpy
-PIL
